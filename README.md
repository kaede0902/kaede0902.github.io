## Why code
* At Univ 1st grade, I started working in a PANASONIC retail
shop.
* They a lot of `paper` and `call` work.
* I suffered that work which relying too much on
its staff's brain memory and eye-confirming

* So I decided to work as a programmer, which can eliminate
paper work, using software technology.
